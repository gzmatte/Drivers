# Debloated Drivers
Isn't that hard, download the zip for the driver, extract it, go to the windows version folder, (example: win10)> SoftwareDriver> Driver> this folder contains the .inf file.
Works with VSG, Redragon & maybe other companies.
This installs the driver only, without software. Normally this won't affect nothing.
