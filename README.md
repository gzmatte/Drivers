# Debloated Drivers
Isn't that hard, download the zip for the driver, extract it, go to the windows version folder, (example: win10)> SoftwareDriver> Driver> this folder contains the .inf file, i zipped this folder for you. (u can delete the x86 folder, if u're in 64bits.)
Works with VSG, Redragon & others companies that uses a normal driver.
This installs the driver only, without software. Normally this won't affect nothing, and give you a boost in performance.
